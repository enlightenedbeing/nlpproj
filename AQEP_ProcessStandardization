AQEP Projects Standardization:
----------------------------------

Standard Template for AQEP Forms:
	- number of tiers
	- scoring tiers
	- 

AQEP Form understanding - from ops team - 1 week

Non-Assumption approach for AQEP

AQEP Internal review - doubts/ - 1 week

AQEP Form reflection after internal review - 1 week

server procurement - AWS, app instance - timelines 
user creation, roles, permissions
lob - hunt group extention details
datasource - speech 
ETL - 1 day
AQEP timelines - 3 weeks (no dependency on transcription till speech gets ready)
Parameter Wise - target  -->  
NLP-Run will depend on data ingestion.

ETL + Datasource Testing on AWS server

Server procurement should be initiated from first day.

latest 90 days audit data from ops team - send contact-ids to Bill if he can give audio/metadata

Daily volume data based on AHT take 80% training, 20 % testing standard for any project.
generate keywords from daily volume 80% data, test against 20% daily volume data

Usually when do they share volume information ??

Performance testing for SensAI to be done for 5000 calls.
	some parameters are bound to be slow such as CRM validations
	some parameters are fast such as AHT
	some parameters are medium such as normal AQEP rule with 3-4 keyword groups.

----------------------------

ANy project

First 3-4 days AQEP sessions for 2 hours to understand each parameters
(Internal review meeting)
What if additional developement required ?
	is it show stopper ? --> need to develop on priority
	if it can be managed --> plan
Within first week need to share timelines
Within first week need to start creating users, roles, permissions ()
Server procurement should be done from first day
Based on daily volume data (based on aht)--> take 80% for training, 20% for testing
take 80% training data
	run statistics

	create keyword groups 

from first day itself --> get 1 day volume ground truth for aqep 
	share those contact ids with bill for audio/metadata 
	discuss with bill if based on contact id , it can be downloaded or not.

ETL on AWS needs to be tested
SensAI performance to be tested for one day volume data (~5000)


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Project processes standardization:
	- Standard process for AQEP/NLP projects.
		- From first day of project that is first interaction with Ops team to understand AQEP form with all its parameters.
		- Things to be initiated from day one.
			- Continuous 3 day sessions for 2 hours approx to understand AQEP/NLP rules for any client, scoring mechanism, feasibility, internal review.

			- After internal review, timelines for project to be discussed and shared with stakeholders.

			- Initiate server procurement for new client (standard configuration based on daily/monthly data volume plus SensAI requirements)

				Raise ticket to TSG on GSD portal (which can take 2 weeks)
			
			- Create temporory app instance somewhere 
			
			- Initiate users/roles/group creation request (a mail to seek this information should be sent)
			
			- creation of users, roles, groups
			
			- Based on bandwidth, AQEP rules configuration on App to be started on temporory app instance.
			
			- Initiate based on daily volume (~400-500hours, ~5000) and aht , seek ground truth from Ops team in template shared by App team for one day data.

		- Based on groundtruth, contact_ids, lob, date --> seek audio calls, metadata from Bill (Connect with Bill to check feasbility) --> 2,3 days

		- Take 80% data from daily volume for training, 20% for testing.
			run statistics, clustering to create keyword groups. --> 2,3 days
		- Take 20% of test data for testing. --> 2,3 days

		- performance metrices generations 
			precision, recall, f1 score		

			iteration-1 --> more stable number 
			iteration-2 --> minor retuning, addition of few more keywords
			iteration-3 -->

		- Once daily processing data is avaible start, ETL , NLP run, Scheduler 
		
		- Once in two weeks --> new sample report to be generated and shared to Ops team
		
		- Once Measures are stable, monthly one report to be shared to Ops team for validation.

General guidelines:
--------------------

1. Communicate everything over mail. 

2. Regular follow up mail should be sent weekly or if waiting reply from thier end till agreed upon date , next day one mail should be sent asking for the information.

3. Mark manager in all communication with stake holders.

4. After every meeting , minutes of meeting (MoM) should be sent to all stake holder, marking manager in cc. 

5. if no response from follow up, set up a meeting within next day. 

6. Practice Feedback, Review, Code review, demo of work:
	- 

	



"{\"Transferred to Voicemail\": [true, true, \"MATCHED AND CORRECT\", \"Transferred to Voicemail\", \"('Transferred to Voicemail',)\"]}"

"{\"On Hold For More Than 3 Minutes\": [true, false, \"MATCHED BUT NOT CORRECT\", \"On Hold For More Than 3 Minutes\", \"('Transferred to Voicemail',)\"]}"
